# Rules for Code Contributions
## General Guidelines
1. **Code Quality**: Ensure that your code is clean, well-documented, and follows the project's coding standards.
2. **Testing**: Dont need test
3. TypeScript: Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience. Ensure that types are correctly defined and used throughout the codebase.
4. **Linting**: Use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code style consistency. Run the linter before committing your changes.
4. **Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the changes made.
5. Prefer functional components and hooks over class components in React.
6. **Dependencies**: Only add dependencies that are necessary for the project. Avoid bloating the project with unnecessary libraries.
7. **Code Reviews**: Be open to feedback and willing to make changes based on code review comments.
8. Use shadcn UI 2.7.0 components for ui components.
9. use Laravel 12 and Laravel Inertia
10. Follow Laravel 12 conventions for routing, controllers, and models.
11. Use Inertia.js for building single-page applications with Laravel.
12. Use modern gradient color schemes for government website design with elegant and professional styling.
13. Implement line-based design with gradient backgrounds and modern visual elements.
14. Use Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring that styles are consistent and responsive.
15. Use Laravel Permission from spatie for role management and access control.

## Gradient Color Palette
Use these specific gradients for consistent design:
- **Primary Gradient**: From #731CA5 to #4C1D95 (main backgrounds, hero sections)
- **Accent Gradient**: From #8B2FC7 to #5B21B6 (buttons, cards, highlights)
- **Secondary Gradient**: From #5B21B6 to #3730A3 (hover states, special elements)
- **Footer Gradient**: From #3730A3 to #1E1B4B (footer, dark sections)

## Color Usage Guidelines
- Maintain high contrast for text readability over gradients
- Use white or dark text depending on gradient intensity
- Ensure accessibility standards are met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Apply gradients elegantly without overwhelming the professional look

# For UI UX
1. Minimalist & Flat UI Design (Using Lines for Separation or Emphasis)
In this style, lines are often used very sparingly and functionally.

Content Dividers: Thin lines are frequently used to separate sections of content, columns, or rows in tables, providing structure without visually cluttering the interface. You can see examples in social media feeds or to-do list apps that separate each item with a subtle line.

Element Borders: Lines are used as borders for buttons, input fields, or cards to define interactive areas or group information.

Line Icons: Icons that consist only of simple lines are very common in modern UI because they are clean and easily recognizable.

2. Functional Geometric Design
This style uses geometric shapes and lines, but with a clear purpose, rather than creating random patterns.

Grid Systems: UI designs are often built upon grid systems that use imaginary (or sometimes subtly displayed) lines to align elements and create a neat, organized layout.

Diagrams & Charts: Lines are used to connect data points, show process flows, or form clear and readable bar/line graphs. This is very common in analytics dashboards or financial applications.

Progress Bars: A line is used as a progress indicator, filling up or changing color as a task is completed.

3. Industrial or Technical UI Design
This style often uses bold, solid, and assertive lines to convey precision, strength, and functionality.

Schematic/Blueprint Style: Inspired by technical drawings, it often uses monochromatic lines with varying thicknesses to show detail and structure.

Flowcharts/Workflow Lines: Arrows and connecting lines are used to map out processes, workflows, or user interactions in complex applications.

Essentially, if you want a line-based design without abstraction, you'll be focusing on the function, structure, regularity, and clarity that these lines provide. These lines will have a clear purpose: to divide, point, form, or indicate something straightforwardly.
